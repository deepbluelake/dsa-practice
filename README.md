# ðŸ’» DSA Practice Repository ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Problem-Solving Playground** â€” a structured repository where I practice Data Structures and Algorithms consistently to level up for tech interviews and competitive programming.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

Each DSA topic is neatly organized into separate folders.  
Every folder includes:

- `main.cpp`: My daily problem-solving & practice code.
- `file.cpp`: A curated collection of **standard implementations** (like `BFS`, `DFS`, `binary search`, etc).
